              I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand it well as I may, 
              my comprehension can only be an <strong>infinitesimal</strong> fraction of all I want to
              understand about the many connections and relations which occur to me, how the matter in question
              was first thought of or arrived at, etc., etc.<br>
